Project Name: Fashionable

Design Process:
For my assignment 1, I will be creating a website that promotes fashion in general such as clothings and shoes.  I hope to create a spotlight to shine on my company using this website to attract more customers into buying our products.

This website is for people who like to dress up or people in general as our products are affordable for all. 
As a user, I want the website to be user friendly, easy to navigate and at the same time aesthetic looking for both mobile and desktop view.

If a user presses into the catogory of clothes, it will show a list of clothes of that specific type that a user pressed into.
As a user type a specific clothing, I want to display relevant results to the user.

Features:
Hamburger Menu, it is a responsive menu meant for mobile such that it can be easily accessed and it looks good on mobile view

Promo code, allows user to enter a code in the promo code box to obtain a discount for the total cost

Features left to implement:
Search function, it is a feature to search for specific clothes in the shop and displaying it if found, else displaying "Nothing found"

Adding to cart, it is a feature for the users to click the cart icons beside the description of the items being sold to successfully add them into the cart which then can be corresponded to the item being bought and the total price in the checkout page

Technologies used:
https://fontawesome.com/icons For the icons used in the navigation bar such as the cart icon and the home icon
HTML
CSS
Javascript

Testing:
When an user whether in desktop or mobile tries to

(1) Presses into the home icon at the navigation bar, verify that it will bring them to index.html which is the home page of this website
(2) Presses into the Store/Shop icon at the navigation bar, verify that it will bring them to shop.html which displays all item sold in this website
(3) Presses into the Cart icon at the navigation bar, verify that it will bring them into checkout.html which shows what the user have added into their cart, total cost and the checkout button
(4) Presses into Shop Now in main page under the heading You can be fashionable

When a user try to redeem the code in checkout.html, when user type in the text box below the label "Promo Code", "First1", verify that it will alert a message "Code redeemed successfully. Total cost is deducted by $10" and the total cost has been decreased by 10. 
Additionally, when the user types the same promo code like "First1" again, verify that an alert with the message "Code has already been redeemed". 
Also, when the user types "resetcode", verify that it will alert a message "Code resetted" and the code that was once used will be usable again.
To add on, when the user tries to type anything other than the valid codes, verify that it will alert a message that say "Invalid code."
Lastly, when the user types "First1" and then "resetcode", verify the total cost will first decrease by 10 when redeemed "First1" and increase back to the original amount.

In mobile view,
When the user tries to press the hamburger menu on the right, verify the menu will slide in from the left and display the menu

The website is responsive to mobile and desktop.
Some elements of the website will look weird and out of place if the website is reduced to a size that isnt both desktop and mobile
