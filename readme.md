For my assignment 1, I will be creating a website that promotes fashion in general such as clothings and shoes.  I hope to create a spotlight to shine on my company using this website to attract more customers into buying our products.

This website is for people who like to dress up or people in general as our products are affordable for all.  In terms of designing this website, the website will have couple of categories of clothes at the top of the website while the main page will consist of the hottest item or discount sales.

If a user presses into the catogory of clothes, it will show a list of clothes of that specific type that a user pressed into.
If a user presses into the main page, it will be them to a section where the item or discount will be shown.
