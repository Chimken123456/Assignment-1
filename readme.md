Project Name: Fashionable

Design Process:
For my assignment 1, I will be creating a website that promotes fashion in general such as clothings and shoes.  I hope to create a spotlight to shine on my company using this website to attract more customers into buying our products.

This website is for people who like to dress up or people in general as our products are affordable for all.  In terms of designing this website, the website will have couple of categories of clothes at the top of the website while the main page will consist of the hottest item or discount sales.

If a user presses into the catogory of clothes, it will show a list of clothes of that specific type that a user pressed into.
As a user type a specific clothing, I want to display relevant results to the user.

Features:

Features left to implement:
Having the search box to work such that the user can use it to search specific item that the user wants
Category boxes to work such that it displays item specifically to that category
